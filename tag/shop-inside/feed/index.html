		<description><![CDATA[Black Cat is a vibrant, well-established vegan cafe in the heart of Hackney – a great choice for lunch, dinner or coffee.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-operatively run Black Cat opened in 2013, taking over from Pogo Cafe, a volunteer-led vegan hangout. Since then, Black Cat has firmly laid down roots in the community, offering a menu of simple, flavoursome dishes and hosting fundraising nights for various causes and rights groups close to its heart.</p>
<p>Outside, the cafe&#8217;s colourful stripes call for attention, but inside the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. You&#8217;ll find the menu, which changes daily, on a chalkboard behind the counter where you place your order.</p>
<p>There are three or four hearty mains, vegan versions of British &#8216;favourites&#8217; that often include a tofu burger with chips; a curry; and a hearty, traditional meal such as shepherd&#8217;s pie with lentils, &#8216;chicken&#8217; pot pie or fishless and chips. </p>
<p>There are also tasty pizzas, layered with vegan cheese and topped with soya, that you can buy whole or by the slice. The salad is a fancy, expertly dressed mix of vegetables, slaw and grains. It comes in two sizes and is served with bread (available gluten-free). There are also stacks of vegan sausage rolls and samosas to tempt you at the counter, if you&#8217;re after a snack, and a range of decadent desserts (cakes, brownies, meringue, ice cream) if you&#8217;re in the mood for something sweet.</p>
<p>Of a weekend, the cafe services brunch. Vegan croissants, pain au chocolat, and a big cooked breakfast of vegan sausage, tofu scramble, mushrooms, tomatoes, homemade beans and toast. </p>
<p>Drinks include delicious, flavoured soya milkshakes and a good selection of hot and soft drinks. Alcohol isn&#8217;t served, but you can bring your own for a small corkage fee.</p>
<p>As well as the food from the menu, you can also buy lots of vegan snacks and chocolates, tofu, tempeh, vegan cheese and other fresh food to take home.</p>
<p>Following rapid change in Hackney and an explosion of new bars and restaurants nearby, Black Cat&#8217;s popularity is growing. There may be fewer punks and more prams at the tables, but it&#8217;s a sign of the cafe&#8217;s success that it&#8217;s equally loved by both vegans and others alike. With such a range of appetising options, it&#8217;s no surprise.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A warm welcome awaits you at Carenvale, a homely vegetarian restaurant that serves up traditional Mediterranean food.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small interior, which seats about 12, helps to create a cosy atmosphere, along with the low lighting, worn wooden tables, and the pleasant sound of quiet conversations. The decor is simple and sparse: Carnevale focuses its attention – and yours – on its food.</p>
<p>When you arrive, staff ask you about your dietary requirements, so they can recommend suitable dishes. If you’re dining before 7pm, you can opt for the three-course set menu – at £13.50, it’s good value for money. Otherwise, with starters reaching £7.25 and mains at £13.50, Carnevale may be more expensive than expected, but the food is reliably good and substantial in size. All dishes are prepared to order with fresh, flavoursome ingredients.</p>
<p>Alongside veggie dishes, there are plenty of vegan and gluten-free options. The starters include savoury pancakes filled with spinach and ricotta; and young artichokes stuffed with walnuts, lemon, parsley and breadcrumbs. The most popular mains are potato cakes with fennel, lemon and basil, served with a provencal vegetable casserole; a falafel, aubergine and red pepper harissa casserole; and a chickpea, lentil and spinach curry served with marinated halloumi and fig kebabs.</p>
<p>There’s a selection of desserts (the vegan chocolate roulade is a big hit), sweet wines and digestifs. And there’s all the tea, coffee, organic wine, spirits and soft drinks you need. There’s also a small deli at the front of the restaurant, selling pasta, grains and other Mediterranean foods to take home.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the mood for hearty food in a homely setting, give Carnevale a try. Given the size of the restaurant – and the fact it’s just down the street from the popular Barbican Centre – it’s worth booking ahead to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>That’s not all from Carnevale: if you’re passing on a weekday at lunchtime, check out its popular market stall, <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/saladin/">Saladin</a>, just outside.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone deserves great cake – that’s the joyous vision of Ms Cupcake, a vegan bakery in Brixton Village. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ms Cupcake was founded in 2011 by Mellissa Morgan. She had moved to London from Canada, many years previously, and noticed a gap in the market for vegan sweet treats. In 2010, Mellissa decided to fill it herself. She began baking indulgent vegan cakes at home and selling them at London markets. Just one year later, due the high demand for her specialist treats, Mellissa set up shop in Brixton Village.</p>
<p>Inside Ms Cupcake, you’ll find freshly baked cupcakes, layer cakes, cookies, muffins, squares, sandwiches, savoury treats, milkshakes and ice-cream sodas. Everything is 100% vegan and a fair share of the baked goods are free from wheat and gluten. Most customers probably don’t even realise this, which is a testament to the texture and flavour of the cakes.</p>
<p>The bakery has an open-plan layout, which means everything is baked and decorated on the premises in front of customers. The friendly staff are more than happy to talk you through their wide range of mouth-watering cupcakes (including lemon, banoffee, strawberry champagne, black forest, raspberry cheesecake, rose and red velvet); brownies (including Oreo and walnut); and many other decadent treats.</p>
<p>Most of the cupcakes are priced at £2.60, and the other sweet treats at around £3. Thankfully, being naughty won’t break the bank.</p>
