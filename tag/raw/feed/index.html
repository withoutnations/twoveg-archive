		<description><![CDATA[Nestled in the impressive conservatory inside My Hotel in Chelsea, Tanya's specialises in innovative raw food and 'superfood cocktails'.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The upmarket cafe takes its name from co-founder Tanya Alekseeva, author of the Better Raw blog, who describes herself as a raw-food specialist and holistic wellness coach. True to Tanya&#8217;s principles, everything on the menu is raw, plant-based and free from refined sugar and gluten.</p>
<p>The restaurant&#8217;s setting perfectly complements its raw-food menu: the abundance of light, plants and wooden furnishings effectively brings the outside in. It’s a stylish, comfortable place that&#8217;s perfect for intimate catch-ups with friends and family.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never tried raw cuisine before, it&#8217;s likely that Tanya&#8217;s will convince you of its merits. The dishes are original and elegant, designed both to nourish and energise. Brunch is served from 11am to 3pm, with options including &#8216;avo un-toast&#8217; (soft, dehydrated onion bread with squashed avocado and chili flakes) and cinnamon chia (chia seeds in homemade almond milk with cinnamon, vanilla and seasonal fruits). There&#8217;s a variety of cold-pressed juices and nut-milk coffees to quench your thirst.</p>
<p>After midday, the menu widens. You can choose from a range of salads, inspired by different cuisines, and &#8216;living mains&#8217; including Thai curry kelp noodles, a nori wrap and lasagna (layers of herbed almond and cashew ricotta, sundried tomato marinara, walnut mushroom meat and basil pesto, between sheets of courgette pasta). There&#8217;s also a good selection of tasty sides and dips. The treats – &#8216;cheezecakes&#8217;, mini slices and raw chocolates – are just as delicious as their traditional baked counterparts. And then there’s the cafe&#8217;s speciality cocktails made with ethically sourced alcohol, fresh fruits and so-called &#8216;superfoods&#8217;. The combinations include hazelnut-infused vodka, cacao, acai berry, fresh raspberries and maple syrup – a cocktail aptly named &#8216;Filthy Rich&#8217;.</p>
<p>The popularity of raw-food eateries is growing in London, and Tanya&#8217;s, with its fine food and excellent service, demonstrates why.</p>
