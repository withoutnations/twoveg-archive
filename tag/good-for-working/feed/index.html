		<description><![CDATA[Black Cat is a vibrant, well-established vegan cafe in the heart of Hackney – a great choice for lunch, dinner or coffee.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-operatively run Black Cat opened in 2013, taking over from Pogo Cafe, a volunteer-led vegan hangout. Since then, Black Cat has firmly laid down roots in the community, offering a menu of simple, flavoursome dishes and hosting fundraising nights for various causes and rights groups close to its heart.</p>
<p>Outside, the cafe&#8217;s colourful stripes call for attention, but inside the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. You&#8217;ll find the menu, which changes daily, on a chalkboard behind the counter where you place your order.</p>
<p>There are three or four hearty mains, vegan versions of British &#8216;favourites&#8217; that often include a tofu burger with chips; a curry; and a hearty, traditional meal such as shepherd&#8217;s pie with lentils, &#8216;chicken&#8217; pot pie or fishless and chips. </p>
<p>There are also tasty pizzas, layered with vegan cheese and topped with soya, that you can buy whole or by the slice. The salad is a fancy, expertly dressed mix of vegetables, slaw and grains. It comes in two sizes and is served with bread (available gluten-free). There are also stacks of vegan sausage rolls and samosas to tempt you at the counter, if you&#8217;re after a snack, and a range of decadent desserts (cakes, brownies, meringue, ice cream) if you&#8217;re in the mood for something sweet.</p>
<p>Of a weekend, the cafe services brunch. Vegan croissants, pain au chocolat, and a big cooked breakfast of vegan sausage, tofu scramble, mushrooms, tomatoes, homemade beans and toast. </p>
<p>Drinks include delicious, flavoured soya milkshakes and a good selection of hot and soft drinks. Alcohol isn&#8217;t served, but you can bring your own for a small corkage fee.</p>
<p>As well as the food from the menu, you can also buy lots of vegan snacks and chocolates, tofu, tempeh, vegan cheese and other fresh food to take home.</p>
<p>Following rapid change in Hackney and an explosion of new bars and restaurants nearby, Black Cat&#8217;s popularity is growing. There may be fewer punks and more prams at the tables, but it&#8217;s a sign of the cafe&#8217;s success that it&#8217;s equally loved by both vegans and others alike. With such a range of appetising options, it&#8217;s no surprise.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Café Van Gogh is a vibrant, non-profit vegan cafe on Brixton Road. Its creative, international menu attracts diners from all over London.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cafe is independent of the church it&#8217;s adjoined to and is run by community interest company Raw Ingredients. It&#8217;s open every day except Monday for lunch, and stays open for dinner on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, when you&#8217;re invited to bring your own alcohol for <label>£2 a head</label>. Brunch is served on Saturdays, from 10am, and a hearty roast dinner is added to the menu on Sundays.</p>
<p>The lunch and dinner menus change every week, but you&#8217;ll find creative dishes such as a beetroot burger served with beetroot chips and slaw; jackfruit and aubergine shawarma; vegan mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese; lentil bolognese on penne; and jerk plantain with mango salsa and turmeric cous cous.</p>
<p>On the tantalising Saturday brunch menu: huevos rancheros with homefries and smoky black beans; jerk plantain with scrambled tofu; a full vegan &#8216;traditional&#8217; cooked breakfast, and more. The Sunday menu holds its own too, with a nut roast wellington served with roast vegetables and gravy. The food is always tasty and the portions generous.</p>
<p>When you enter the cafe, vibrant Van Gogh prints and impressionist murals welcome you into an airy room that opens up onto a large courtyard with seating. Colourful fairy lights lead the way up a spiral staircase to a charming room with many angles, many small windows and ‘The Starry Night’ painted on the ceiling.</p>
<p>There’s nothing pretentious about Café Van Gogh – with its chequered tablecloths and bric-a-brac on the shelves – and that’s probably why it attracts a good mix of people. It’s the type of relaxed place you can enjoy with a group or on your own. It’s the norm to see people reading the weekend papers or working with a coffee. So, if you’re looking for a quirky, arty cafe with great food and friendly staff, you’ve found it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This friendly vegetarian cafe on Holloway Road is a real find. With great food and coffee, it's the perfect place for a quiet catch up. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EZ &#038; Moss has been brightening up Holloway Road since it opened its doors in 2013. The charming cafe, with its simple but delicious veggie and vegan food, is a hit with both locals and those who work nearby. </p>
<p>Inside, the long, narrow cafe is light and tranquil; tables for two made out of reclaimed wood line one wall, and a small kitchen and counter line the wall opposite. There’s a larger table at the front of the cafe, under the window, and a few seats outside if you fancy watching the world go by.</p>
<p>Fresh flowers in vases, dried flowers in old food tins, soft lighting, scaffold shelving, vintage signs and quirky pictures give the cafe a style that’s part bohemian, part industrial. The music is low, making conversation – or working without distraction – easy.</p>
<p>The menu is concise but caters perfectly well for those looking for breakfast, brunch or lunch. There’s porridge, chia pudding, homemade granola, scrambled eggs on toast, veggie and vegan omelettes, and a larger breakfast consisting of two soft-boiled eggs, British cheese, avocado, cucumber, tomatoes and toast. Avocado on toast is served with chilli-coriander relish, watercress and <em>dukkah</em> (a mixture of nuts and spices), which turns a simple dish into an outstanding one. </p>
<p>For lunch, there’s a range of grilled sandwiches, an impressive vegan lentil and quinoa burger, and a &#8216;veganwarma&#8217; served on flatbread with coleslaw, potato salad, tahini sauce and pickles. Daily specials include a fresh salad, a quiche and a soup. All of the food is served on vintage crockery, adding to the cafe’s charm. </p>
<p>You can find a good selection of veggie and vegan cakes at the counter, and Allpress coffee, which you can take out if you’re just passing by. But it’s worth staying a while, if you can – this place has something special.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The delicious galettes, good prices and cosy atmosphere have made Maloko a big hit with Camberwell's creative community.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The charming combination of mismatched furniture, local art on the walls, fresh flowers, upbeat music and the ever-present smile of Cameroonian owner Evagle Francklin, makes Maloko a great place for meetups. And then there’s the food.</p>
<p>Galettes are Maloko’s raison d’être. Made from buckwheat – which is neither a grain nor related to wheat, but a distant relative of rhubarb – the galettes are gluten-free. There’s a range of vegetarian or vegan fillings to choose from, including sweet potato, spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, goats cheese, beetroot and jerk tofu. Served with a fresh side salad, the galettes are crispy on the outside and bursting with flavour on the inside. Size-wise, galette can be a substantial lunch or a more-than-adequate dinner.</p>
<p>Also on the menu are traditional crêpes with sweet fillings, and teas, coffees and reasonably priced fresh juices.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for somewhere south of the river that’s informal, friendly and a little bit different, Maloko’s the place.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Gallery Cafe is a lively, not-for-profit vegan cafe and events venue in the heart of Bethnal Green.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cafe is one of many projects run by St Margaret’s House, a Bethnal Green charity that has been supporting creativity, wellbeing and cultural events in the local community since 1889.</p>
<p>Attached to the grand St Margaret’s House, the cafe is large, with high ceilings, a wooden parquet floor, local artwork on the walls, and a conservatory at the back, which allows light to pour in during the day. In the evening, low lighting and fairy lights create cosiness and warmth. The tables comfortably seat four, and there’s plenty of outdoor seating too.</p>
<p>Inside, low music is drowned out by the sound of lively conversation. Despite being busy, and at times noisy, the cafe has a relaxed atmosphere. It’s common for people to drop by to work or read a book while having a coffee or a bite to eat.</p>
<p>The cafe serves breakfast until 12pm, with options including a full English, potato pancakes, a superfood breakfast bowl and avocado on toast. The lunch menu is then available from 12pm to 5pm, which includes a roasted veggie wrap, falafel wrap, classic burger, stir fry, and three seasonal daily specials.</p>
<p>Also on offer are fresh focaccia sandwiches with fillings like vegan sausage or avocado and pesto; cupcakes (occasionally from <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/ms-cupcake/">Ms Cupcake</a>); cookies and pastries. There’s the usual hot drinks, soft drinks and fresh juices to choose from, plus wine and beer.</p>
<p>Events are held throughout the week at St Margaret’s House and in The Gallery Cafe itself. There are film screenings, live music nights, yoga sessions, arts projects and a book club – many are free.</p>
<p>The Gallery Cafe and St Margaret’s House have a lot to offer, and as all of the cafe&#8217;s profits go straight back into the charity, you’re not the only one who’ll benefit from your visit.</p>
