		<description><![CDATA[Black Cat is a vibrant, well-established vegan cafe in the heart of Hackney – a great choice for lunch, dinner or coffee.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-operatively run Black Cat opened in 2013, taking over from Pogo Cafe, a volunteer-led vegan hangout. Since then, Black Cat has firmly laid down roots in the community, offering a menu of simple, flavoursome dishes and hosting fundraising nights for various causes and rights groups close to its heart.</p>
<p>Outside, the cafe&#8217;s colourful stripes call for attention, but inside the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. You&#8217;ll find the menu, which changes daily, on a chalkboard behind the counter where you place your order.</p>
<p>There are three or four hearty mains, vegan versions of British &#8216;favourites&#8217; that often include a tofu burger with chips; a curry; and a hearty, traditional meal such as shepherd&#8217;s pie with lentils, &#8216;chicken&#8217; pot pie or fishless and chips. </p>
<p>There are also tasty pizzas, layered with vegan cheese and topped with soya, that you can buy whole or by the slice. The salad is a fancy, expertly dressed mix of vegetables, slaw and grains. It comes in two sizes and is served with bread (available gluten-free). There are also stacks of vegan sausage rolls and samosas to tempt you at the counter, if you&#8217;re after a snack, and a range of decadent desserts (cakes, brownies, meringue, ice cream) if you&#8217;re in the mood for something sweet.</p>
<p>Of a weekend, the cafe services brunch. Vegan croissants, pain au chocolat, and a big cooked breakfast of vegan sausage, tofu scramble, mushrooms, tomatoes, homemade beans and toast. </p>
<p>Drinks include delicious, flavoured soya milkshakes and a good selection of hot and soft drinks. Alcohol isn&#8217;t served, but you can bring your own for a small corkage fee.</p>
<p>As well as the food from the menu, you can also buy lots of vegan snacks and chocolates, tofu, tempeh, vegan cheese and other fresh food to take home.</p>
<p>Following rapid change in Hackney and an explosion of new bars and restaurants nearby, Black Cat&#8217;s popularity is growing. There may be fewer punks and more prams at the tables, but it&#8217;s a sign of the cafe&#8217;s success that it&#8217;s equally loved by both vegans and others alike. With such a range of appetising options, it&#8217;s no surprise.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Bonnington Café is a unique, community-run vegetarian cafe with a daily set menu of outstanding food.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a meal at Bonnington Café feels a bit like going for dinner at a friend’s house, thanks to the comfortable, homely setting and delicious home-cooking. The cafe occupies two floors of a converted house and has plenty of charm and character: dried flowers, old clocks, knick-knacks, paintings on the colourful walls and a piano in the corner, make it a warm and welcoming space.</p>
<p>The cafe isn&#8217;t run by a single person but a collective of member cooks who also maintain the space. While some of the cooks do have recurring shifts, the arrangement means no two days are the same and what’s on offer is truly international. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a starter (£3), a main (£8) and a dessert (£3). Each usually has two options to choose between, and will likely include a vegan and gluten-free dish. At least one night a week, the menu is entirely vegan. The cafe is unlicensed, but you’re encouraged to bring your own alcohol. There&#8217;s no corkage fee, but there is a 50p charge for a glass. </p>
<p>The bohemian spirit of the cafe is squarely linked to the history of Bonnington Square, in which it sits. In the 1980s, the square was left vacant. Houses were scheduled for demolition, but squatters moved in, occupied the buildings and, over time, came to own them. The squatters formed a housing collective and established a community garden. They set up Bonnington Centre and, inside, a vegetarian cafe providing a good, cheap meal for the community. </p>
<p>Today, the centre offers yoga and pilates classes, provides counselling and hosts film nights and community events. And, after more than 30 years, Bonnington Café remains one of south London&#8217;s unique treasures. It&#8217;s popular and busy, so book a table in advance by contacting the chef through the cafe&#8217;s <a href="http://bonningtoncafe.co.uk/book.html">website</a>. </p>
<p>Don’t forget to bring cash — cards aren’t accepted.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Café Van Gogh is a vibrant, non-profit vegan cafe on Brixton Road. Its creative, international menu attracts diners from all over London.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cafe is independent of the church it&#8217;s adjoined to and is run by community interest company Raw Ingredients. It&#8217;s open every day except Monday for lunch, and stays open for dinner on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, when you&#8217;re invited to bring your own alcohol for <label>£2 a head</label>. Brunch is served on Saturdays, from 10am, and a hearty roast dinner is added to the menu on Sundays.</p>
<p>The lunch and dinner menus change every week, but you&#8217;ll find creative dishes such as a beetroot burger served with beetroot chips and slaw; jackfruit and aubergine shawarma; vegan mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese; lentil bolognese on penne; and jerk plantain with mango salsa and turmeric cous cous.</p>
<p>On the tantalising Saturday brunch menu: huevos rancheros with homefries and smoky black beans; jerk plantain with scrambled tofu; a full vegan &#8216;traditional&#8217; cooked breakfast, and more. The Sunday menu holds its own too, with a nut roast wellington served with roast vegetables and gravy. The food is always tasty and the portions generous.</p>
<p>When you enter the cafe, vibrant Van Gogh prints and impressionist murals welcome you into an airy room that opens up onto a large courtyard with seating. Colourful fairy lights lead the way up a spiral staircase to a charming room with many angles, many small windows and ‘The Starry Night’ painted on the ceiling.</p>
<p>There’s nothing pretentious about Café Van Gogh – with its chequered tablecloths and bric-a-brac on the shelves – and that’s probably why it attracts a good mix of people. It’s the type of relaxed place you can enjoy with a group or on your own. It’s the norm to see people reading the weekend papers or working with a coffee. So, if you’re looking for a quirky, arty cafe with great food and friendly staff, you’ve found it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Indian Veg has been serving its all-you-can-eat vegetarian and vegan buffet for more than 30 years – and it's as popular as ever.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no mistaking what&#8217;s on offer at Indian Veg. At the top of Chapel Market, the bright green exterior is covered from the pavement up with descriptions of what you&#8217;ll find inside, how much it will cost and why you should try it. It&#8217;s a tantalising pitch: healthy, vegetarian Indian food that&#8217;s affordable.</p>
<p>The restaurant first opened in 1985 under the name Bhelpuri House. Inside, the room is divided, with some tables near the buffet and others set up on a lower level. The finer details might escape you at first as your attention will likely be on the restaurant&#8217;s defining characteristic: wall to wall posters, newspaper articles, celebrity photos and pseudo-facts (&#8216;carrots keep you younger!&#8217;) about the benefits of living a vegetarian lifestyle. It&#8217;s well-intentioned and sincere – done, in their words, to &#8216;inform, amuse and inspire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The buffet changes daily, but you&#8217;ll usually find a selection of half a dozen hot dishes (vegetable curries, dhal, rice), fried onion snacks, bread, cold salads (onion, carrot, beetroot, red and white cabbage) and fresh pear and mango sides. Staff can answer any questions about the dishes and their ingredients, and point out what meets different dietary requirements (most of the buffet is vegan). A long refrigerator along the wall has a selection of soft drinks. And there&#8217;s a table menu with Indian desserts, and dairy or soy lassis.</p>
<p>While the price of the buffet has risen to £7.95 (half price for a takeaway box), Indian Veg remains a reasonably priced option for great-tasting vegetarian and vegan Indian food in London.</p>
<p><em>Indian Veg offers free food to anyone who is homeless, during normal opening hours.</em></p>
