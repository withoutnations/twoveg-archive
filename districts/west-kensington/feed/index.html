		<description><![CDATA[Looking for homely, hearty vegan food in West Kensington? 222 Vegan Cuisine has plenty.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This popular vegan restaurant (previously 222 Veggie Vegan) opened its doors in 2004 and is run by chef Ben Asamani, who serves up delicious dishes to satisfy your appetite. Everything on the menu is prepared using fresh, natural ingredients and cooking techniques that preserve nutritional value – there&#8217;s no deep-frying or microwaving here.</p>
<p>The all-you-can-eat lunchtime buffet, available from midday to 3.30pm, is good value for money: £7.50 to eat-in or £5.50 for a takeaway box. There’s a selection of tasty raw salads and hot dishes to choose from.</p>
<p>The evening à la carte service starts at 6pm, when the small restaurant fills up quickly. With its minimal decor and candlelit tables, 222 Vegan Cuisine has a cosy, unpretentious atmosphere. The menu is equally down to earth. Starters include homemade soup, a bean and tofu pancake, and pitta bread with dips. The hearty mains include a roast, pasta basilico, pumpkin and pine nut risotto, a tofu veggie burger and the customers’ favourite, seitan stroganoff. Simple dishes, but full of flavour. There are also salads and a couple of raw dishes, if you fancy something lighter. Desserts include tofu cheesecake, ice cream and raw chocolate torte. To quench your thirst: hot drinks, fresh juices and smoothies, and wine and beer with affordable organic options.</p>
<p>The wholesome, satisfying food at 222 Vegan Cuisine is no doubt what makes the restaurant so popular among vegans and non-vegans alike. It’s a big hit with families too. Make sure you book ahead for dinner – the word is definitely out.</p>
