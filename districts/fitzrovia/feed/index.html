		<description><![CDATA[On a quiet road behind Oxford Street sits Ethos, a stylish vegetarian restaurant providing the perfect respite from the crowds.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opened in 2014 by Jessica Kruger, Ethos is dedicated to serving healthy, meat-free cuisine that appeals to a large number of people, including the growing number of so-called flexitarians.</p>
<p>Inside, you’ll find a room of high contrast: a Scandinavian-esque decor of sharp blacks and white brick, marble tabletops and leather seats. Among the booths and tables stand a dozen birch trees – a surprising and striking addition that creates the atmosphere of an upmarket outdoor cafe. It&#8217;s a carefully crafted aesthetic that’s contemporary and minimal, with just enough low lighting and colour for warmth.</p>
<p>The food at Ethos is served buffet style. In the evenings, a table service is offered; a server will seat you and bring a menu with additional starters, drinks and desserts. Otherwise, the buffet is spread across three serving areas: cold salads, hot food and desserts. You help yourself and pay at the till; the weight of your plate will determine the cost.</p>
<p>All of the buffet dishes are made on the day and refilled until they run out (sometimes earlier than may be expected). The last top-up is 30 minutes before closing time. As with most buffets, the selections change depending on the time of day. In the evening, you might find Middle Eastern cuisine (baba ganoush, falafel, pitta), Italian (gnocchi, ricotta marinara, arancini), Asian stirfry, Thai corn fritters, sweet potato shepherd&#8217;s pie, and an impressive array of spinach dishes. And each week there&#8217;s a new &#8216;chef’s special&#8217;. </p>
<p>Breakfast is served on weekdays, brunch on Sunday, and takeaway is available daily. There’s even afternoon tea, with a changing selection of sandwiches, cakes, scones and clotted cream.</p>
<p>Ethos’s particular offering – a variety of healthy, tasty food and sophisticated presentation – has proven to be a popular combination. There’s often a queue, so get in early. It’s worth the wait.</p>
