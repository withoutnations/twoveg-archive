		<description><![CDATA[Vegan Sweet Tooth pops up at markets and festivals across London, selling delicious sweet treats and baked goods.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This charming Italian patisserie stall is run by professional chef Giancarlo Roncato, who turned his hand to vegan baking in 2012. He specialises in organic, &#8216;free-from&#8217; sweet and savoury treats, inspired by his Italian heritage. Across the range of cakes, pastries, breads and quiches, you’ll find different sugar-free, nut-free, gluten-free or soya-free options.</p>
<p>The sweet treats are popular, so it’s a good thing that the stall is well stocked. You’ll find cakes such as blueberry and lavender, lemon and rosemary, carrot and date, and zebra marble; and tarts like chocolate and pear, berry jam, chocolate frangipane and almond frangipane. There are a few more unusual flavour combinations to choose from, like black pepper and strawberry, if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous. And there’s usually a selection of biscuits and muffins on offer, too.</p>
<p>The savoury offerings include delicious pastries, Italian breads such as focaccia, pizza and quiche (for example, spinach, leek, pea and kale), which can be served with a side salad.</p>
<p>Giancarlo is full of passion for vegan baking, and this shines through when you talk to him at the stall. His friendliness and great flavours will no doubt keep you, like many others, going back for more.</p>
<p>To find out where the stall will be popping up next, see Vegan Sweet Tooth&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vegansweettoothlondon/events/?ref=page_internal">Facebook page</a>.</p>
