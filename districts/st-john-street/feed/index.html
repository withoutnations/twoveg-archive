		<description><![CDATA[The Gate in Islington is well-known for its creative vegetarian food that looks as good as it tastes. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brothers Adrian and Michael Daniel opened the second location of The Gate restaurant in Islington in 2012, while <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/gate-hammersmith/">the original</a>, in Hammersmith, underwent renovation. The two restaurants share not only a menu but a reputation for an inventive mixture of culinary influences. </p>
<p>With enormous bay windows that stretch to the high ceiling and an airy interior, the restaurant is surprisingly large in size. Tables are set closely together under low-hanging filament lights, and the arrangement generates a lively hum of conversation. </p>
<p>The seasonal à la carte menu acknowledges what the brothers describe as their &#8216;Indo-Iraqi Jewish&#8217; heritage, threaded through Italian and French cuisine. The dishes are every bit as diverse as that implies. To start, you might find artichokes, halloumi, sesame-coated smoked tofu and a mezzo platter. The mains, to name a few: wild mushroom risotto cake, Malaysian curry and aubergine schnitzel. Make the most of the chunky polenta chips and other sides, and try a dessert if you can – they&#8217;re pretty special. There&#8217;s sticky toffee pudding, strawberry eaton mess, raw basil strawberry tart and more.</p>
<p>Alongside the à la carte menu, there are lunch options that celebrate Spanish and Arabic tastes, Sunday roasts and a children&#8217;s menu. Keep an eye out for special seasonal menus dedicated to a particular theme, such as The Gate&#8217;s annual wild mushroom festival.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good range of organic and vegan wines available, and a full cocktail menu.  </p>
<p>On a typical weeknight, there&#8217;s rarely an empty table at The Gate. Book ahead to miss the waiting list and guarantee yourself a table at what is deservedly one of London&#8217;s most popular vegetarian restaurants.</p>
