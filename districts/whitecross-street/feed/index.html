		<description><![CDATA[The distinctive Buddha Bowl Van in Whitecross Street Market is a great choice for weekday lunchtime veggie goodness. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to stand out in a street-food market as large and diverse as the one on Whitecross Street, but a beautifully converted Citroën H van, known as the &#8216;Buddha Bowl Van&#8217;, does just that. And while the retro wheels may catch the eye of passersby, it’s the award-winning Buddha Bowl that gets hungry market-goers queuing up time and time again.</p>
<p>The signature Buddha Bowl is a box filled with all kinds of goodness: massaman curry with new potatoes, pineapple and soya chunks; carrot and homemade kimchi pickle; steamed seasonal greens (usually kale); organic brown rice; organic omega seeds; and grilled halloumi (optional). The Buddha Bowl is vegan (if you skip the halloumi), wheat-free, gluten-free – and very, very tasty. It’s not surprising that it won Best Main Dish at the British Street Food Awards.</p>
<p>Wife and husband Charlotte and David Bailey, founders of Wholefood Heaven, run the Buddha Bowl Van – with enthusiasm and big smiles. David, a classically trained chef, became vegetarian in 2005 and hasn’t looked back since, while Charlotte, a lifelong vegetarian, spent many years working in the natural health industry. Their ethos is that no matter where you are, you should be able to buy high-quality, nutritious, healthy, ethical and tasty fresh food. If you’re around Old Street on a Thursday or Friday at lunchtime, you’re in luck.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A warm welcome awaits you at Carenvale, a homely vegetarian restaurant that serves up traditional Mediterranean food.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small interior, which seats about 12, helps to create a cosy atmosphere, along with the low lighting, worn wooden tables, and the pleasant sound of quiet conversations. The decor is simple and sparse: Carnevale focuses its attention – and yours – on its food.</p>
<p>When you arrive, staff ask you about your dietary requirements, so they can recommend suitable dishes. If you’re dining before 7pm, you can opt for the three-course set menu – at £13.50, it’s good value for money. Otherwise, with starters reaching £7.25 and mains at £13.50, Carnevale may be more expensive than expected, but the food is reliably good and substantial in size. All dishes are prepared to order with fresh, flavoursome ingredients.</p>
<p>Alongside veggie dishes, there are plenty of vegan and gluten-free options. The starters include savoury pancakes filled with spinach and ricotta; and young artichokes stuffed with walnuts, lemon, parsley and breadcrumbs. The most popular mains are potato cakes with fennel, lemon and basil, served with a provencal vegetable casserole; a falafel, aubergine and red pepper harissa casserole; and a chickpea, lentil and spinach curry served with marinated halloumi and fig kebabs.</p>
<p>There’s a selection of desserts (the vegan chocolate roulade is a big hit), sweet wines and digestifs. And there’s all the tea, coffee, organic wine, spirits and soft drinks you need. There’s also a small deli at the front of the restaurant, selling pasta, grains and other Mediterranean foods to take home.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the mood for hearty food in a homely setting, give Carnevale a try. Given the size of the restaurant – and the fact it’s just down the street from the popular Barbican Centre – it’s worth booking ahead to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>That’s not all from Carnevale: if you’re passing on a weekday at lunchtime, check out its popular market stall, <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/saladin/">Saladin</a>, just outside.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Saladin is a popular food stall in East London's Whitecross Street Market, offering healthy vegetarian and vegan lunches. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every weekday lunchtime, Saladin serves delicious fresh salads and falafel wraps to hungry office workers and passersby. It&#8217;s run by <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/carnevale/">Carnevale</a>, the veggie restaurant it stands outside. </p>
<p>The salad boxes come in two sizes: small and large, which are £4.50 and £5 respectively. The ‘small’ box is by no means small – it’s a miracle it closes given the amount of salad that’s packed in.</p>
<p>You can choose from a range of vegan and veggie salads that are expertly seasoned and dressed. There’s pasta, carrot, Greek salad, beans, mixed greens, tabouleh, new potatoes, broccoli, beetroot and stuffed vine leaves. For an extra 50p, you can enjoy a generous helping of hummus.</p>
<p>The falafel wrap is served with baba ganoush and salad for £5. You can add halloumi for an extra £1. Like the salad boxes, the wrap is a good size and a satisfying lunch.</p>
<p>There are two queues at the stand – one for wraps, the other for salad boxes. They can get long, but thanks to the speed of the friendly staff, you’ll be enjoying your lunch in no time.</p>
