		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to Govinda's, it's still possible to enjoy a delicious vegetarian or vegan meal in Soho for under £10.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Linked to the Radha Krishna Temple that sits above the restaurant, Govinda&#8217;s is run by volunteers belonging to the Hare Krishna movement (the orthodox core of Hinduism). It&#8217;s a testament to the quality of the food, and the commitment of the volunteers, that this unassuming restaurant is still going strong after many years.</p>
<p>Food at Govinda&#8217;s is served canteen-style: you get to see the options, order and pay at the counter, and dine wherever there&#8217;s a free seat. At peak lunch and dinner times, the restaurant fills up with people from all walks of life, and there&#8217;s an informal, friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a wide selection of Indian and non-Indian food. All dishes are vegetarian, and many are suitable for vegans. In line with Hare Krishna beliefs, all of Govinda&#8217;s food is free from onion, garlic and mushrooms – you may expect this to impact upon the taste of the Indian dishes, but it doesn&#8217;t, they are expertly flavoured.</p>
<p>The restaurant&#8217;s signature dish is the all-you-can-eat thali: two vegetable curries, rice, chapattis and a side salad, all served on a large silver plate with the invitation to come back for more. If you&#8217;re not feeling quite so hungry, you can choose a smaller thali, or any of the curries as a main.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not in the mood for Indian cuisine, you can try a veggie burger, pizza, lasagne, egg-free quiche or spinach roll instead, all of which can be served with salad. There are at least 10 different fresh salads available, from simple greens to more adventurous combinations like mango, celery and walnut. All of the menu items are available to take away too.</p>
<p>For dessert, if you can fit it in, there&#8217;s homemade ice cream, cheesecake and traditional Indian sweets. So, again, you&#8217;re spoilt for choice.</p>
<p>Govinda&#8217;s is definitely one of a kind – and one not to be missed.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mildreds Soho is one of the oldest and most well-known vegetarian restaurants in London, popular with locals and tourists alike.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soho has been home to many great vegetarian and vegan places. Sadly, as rents have risen, a number have closed or moved on. Mildreds, however, seems to defy all odds, having been fixed to the neighbourhood for nearly 30 years. </p>
<p>The restaurant is housed in an 18th-century townhouse on Lexington Street: a small building, but one filled with character. The owners have always had a &#8216;no bookings&#8217; policy, which means a healthy crowd inside and out. Tables, mostly set for two, are placed closely together. With a bar at the front (the best place to bide your time before being seated), the narrow space is lively and full of chatter, but not uncomfortable or too loud.</p>
<p>The daily specials chalkboard has been replaced in a recent refurbishment, but the menu continues to offer reliable, hearty mains like a mushroom and ale pie, Sri Lankan sweet potato and green bean curry, and smoked tofu burger. Most of the dishes are vegan or a vegan option is offered. The starters take inspiration from different cuisines; you&#8217;ll find small plates such as gyoza dumplings, pan-fried manouri cheese, artichoke crostini and pizzetta. There are also &#8216;superfood&#8217; salads, and plenty of sides and desserts to choose from. A few options on the menu change seasonally.</p>
<p>The bar serves organic wines, beers and ciders alongside cocktails and mocktails. Most alcoholic drinks are suitable for vegans. There are fresh juices and soft drinks as well. At lunchtime, a takeaway bar offers salads, soups and quiches.</p>
<p>Mildreds is often said to be as popular with those who aren&#8217;t vegetarian or vegan as those who are, and it shows at the door. It&#8217;s always warm and friendly, with a busy cafe ambiance. The owners are now applying their winning formula elsewhere: a second Mildreds opened in <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/mildreds-camden/">Camden</a>, and a third in <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/mildreds-kings-cross/">King&#8217;s Cross</a>.</p>
