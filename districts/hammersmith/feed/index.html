		<description><![CDATA[The Gate in Hammersmith is one of London's longest-serving vegetarian restaurants and a favourite of many.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opened in 1989 by brothers Adrian and Michael Daniel, The Gate has served a menu celebrating Indian, Arabic and Jewish influences for more than 27 years. The Daniels’ success led them to open a <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/gate-islington/">second location</a> in Islington in 2012, and a third in Marylebone in 2016.</p>
<p>The original restaurant is nestled in a small courtyard in Hammersmith. Inside, there&#8217;s an immediate intimacy and warmth, thanks to the low lighting, candles on tables and an eye-catching wall that&#8217;s covered in colourful, reclaimed planks of wood. While tables are set closely together, the room is quiet and it&#8217;s easy to relax and get lost in conversation. Staff are friendly and helpful. During the summer, tables are set up in the courtyard for those lucky enough to dine in the sun.</p>
<p>The seasonal à la carte menu is the same at all three restaurants; there&#8217;s no shortage of options to choose from, and special menus offer unique dishes dedicated to a theme, such as The Gate&#8217;s annual wild mushroom festival. From mizo glazed aubergine to Mediterranean tart, the starters neatly canvas The Gate&#8217;s mixed culinary influences. Mains are no different: rotolo, Malaysian curry, an aubergine schnitzel and what may be the most striking dish, a tower of sweet potato and blackbean tortillas. Salads and sides are also available. A wine rack near the kitchen is well stocked with a selection of organic, vegan options. Stay for a decadent dessert – a soft cappuccino cheesecake, perhaps, or a strawberry eaton mess.</p>
<p>The Gate prides itself on inventive food, combining ingredients in unexpected ways. With a separate menu for children, Sunday roasts and lunch options, there&#8217;s something for everyone. Book ahead – there&#8217;s rarely an empty table in sight.</p>
