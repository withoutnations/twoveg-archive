		<description><![CDATA[The Hackney Downs Vegan Market pops up every Saturday, serving lots of delicious plant-based food and goods.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What began as a monthly market proved so popular that, as of 23 September 2017, it&#8217;s now on every Saturday! </p>
<p>The vegan market is a collaboration between Fat Gay Vegan (​vegan blogger Sean​ ​O&#8217;Callaghan) and EAT WORK ART, which runs Hackney Downs Studios. The stalls change each week – with the exception of a few regulars – but there’s always a good mix providing a range of tasty options. See Fat Gay Vegan&#8217;s <a href="http://fatgayvegan.com/hackney-downs-vegan-market/">website</a> for details of who&#8217;ll be there next time.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a good amount of &#8216;guilty pleasures&#8217; among the healthier food options – and they really draw the crowds. There are cakes, donuts, cupcakes, ice cream and biscuits (Dough Society, Vegan Delice, Sourdough Mess, The Vegan Treaterie, The Sunny Spoon); gourmet burgers (Café SoVegan, Big V London); tacos and burritos (Club Mexicana); pie and mash (Young Vegans); Scotch eggless, sausage rolls (Food! By Lizzi); fried &#8216;chicken&#8217; and &#8216;bacon&#8217; (Temple of Seitan); and fishless and chips (Battered). Plus other stalls offering Vietnamese food, curries, waffles, mac &#8216;no&#8217; cheese, salads and even a döner kebab. </p>
<p>The market is on from 11am to 5pm, but get there early as the most popular food can sell out in the first couple of hours when it&#8217;s busy.</p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s not all about the food: you&#8217;ll also find a vegan beer bar, refreshing gin cocktails, pop-up shops offering handmade vegan goods (such as soap and up-cycled clothing), and artists showcasing their work. The market is a brilliant addition to a new wave of vegan places in London and, hopefully, it&#8217;ll be the first of many.</p>
<p><em>Market stalls curated by Fat Gay Vegan are selected under an <a href="http://fatgayvegan.com/2017/02/25/monthly-vegan-market-in-london/">inclusive policy</a>.</em></p>
