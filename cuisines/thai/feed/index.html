		<description><![CDATA[The distinctive Buddha Bowl Van in Whitecross Street Market is a great choice for weekday lunchtime veggie goodness. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to stand out in a street-food market as large and diverse as the one on Whitecross Street, but a beautifully converted Citroën H van, known as the &#8216;Buddha Bowl Van&#8217;, does just that. And while the retro wheels may catch the eye of passersby, it’s the award-winning Buddha Bowl that gets hungry market-goers queuing up time and time again.</p>
<p>The signature Buddha Bowl is a box filled with all kinds of goodness: massaman curry with new potatoes, pineapple and soya chunks; carrot and homemade kimchi pickle; steamed seasonal greens (usually kale); organic brown rice; organic omega seeds; and grilled halloumi (optional). The Buddha Bowl is vegan (if you skip the halloumi), wheat-free, gluten-free – and very, very tasty. It’s not surprising that it won Best Main Dish at the British Street Food Awards.</p>
<p>Wife and husband Charlotte and David Bailey, founders of Wholefood Heaven, run the Buddha Bowl Van – with enthusiasm and big smiles. David, a classically trained chef, became vegetarian in 2005 and hasn’t looked back since, while Charlotte, a lifelong vegetarian, spent many years working in the natural health industry. Their ethos is that no matter where you are, you should be able to buy high-quality, nutritious, healthy, ethical and tasty fresh food. If you’re around Old Street on a Thursday or Friday at lunchtime, you’re in luck.</p>
