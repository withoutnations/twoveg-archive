		<description><![CDATA[Cookies, cakes, brownies and shakes await you at this Holloway bakery – all vegan, gluten-free and delicious.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cookies and Scream began selling vegan bakes from a market stall in Camden Lock back in 2010. Two years later, as demand grew, the stall turned into a <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/cookies-and-scream-camden/">permanent cookie bar</a> inside the market – this remained hugely popular until a fire in 2017 sadly forced it to close. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Cookies and Scream had opened a bakery on Holloway Road in 2016, not too far from Highbury and Islington station. It&#8217;s a small, friendly place with a few tables and chairs, and retro bar stools you can pull up to the counter.</p>
<p>The glass display case that greets you when you walk through the door shows off tempting fresh bakes – all of which are vegan and gluten-free. What’s on offer changes daily and varies by demand, but the selection is impressive.</p>
<p>The cookies are big and filling, crispy on the edge and moist in the middle; varieties like chocolate chip, oatmeal and chocolate chip, double chocolate, and ginger. There are brownies, blondies (brownies without the cocoa), pies and oven-baked donuts, with winning flavour combinations such as peanut butter and chocolate, coconut and jam, and salted caramel and chocolate. The bakes taste even better when they&#8217;re warmed in the oven. Then there&#8217;s the signature cookie ‘sandwich’, which packs a creamy ice cream between two delicious cookies – definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>The bakery also serves coffee, tea and its popular &#8216;Scream Shakes&#8217;: a combination of ice cream, milk and blended brownie or cookie, served with a specially developed sauce or fresh fruit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something to satisfy everyone’s sweet tooth at Cookies and Scream – it&#8217;s well worth a trip when you fancy a treat.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Hackney Downs Vegan Market pops up every Saturday, serving lots of delicious plant-based food and goods.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What began as a monthly market proved so popular that, as of 23 September 2017, it&#8217;s now on every Saturday! </p>
<p>The vegan market is a collaboration between Fat Gay Vegan (​vegan blogger Sean​ ​O&#8217;Callaghan) and EAT WORK ART, which runs Hackney Downs Studios. The stalls change each week – with the exception of a few regulars – but there’s always a good mix providing a range of tasty options. See Fat Gay Vegan&#8217;s <a href="http://fatgayvegan.com/hackney-downs-vegan-market/">website</a> for details of who&#8217;ll be there next time.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a good amount of &#8216;guilty pleasures&#8217; among the healthier food options – and they really draw the crowds. There are cakes, donuts, cupcakes, ice cream and biscuits (Dough Society, Vegan Delice, Sourdough Mess, The Vegan Treaterie, The Sunny Spoon); gourmet burgers (Café SoVegan, Big V London); tacos and burritos (Club Mexicana); pie and mash (Young Vegans); Scotch eggless, sausage rolls (Food! By Lizzi); fried &#8216;chicken&#8217; and &#8216;bacon&#8217; (Temple of Seitan); and fishless and chips (Battered). Plus other stalls offering Vietnamese food, curries, waffles, mac &#8216;no&#8217; cheese, salads and even a döner kebab. </p>
<p>The market is on from 11am to 5pm, but get there early as the most popular food can sell out in the first couple of hours when it&#8217;s busy.</p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s not all about the food: you&#8217;ll also find a vegan beer bar, refreshing gin cocktails, pop-up shops offering handmade vegan goods (such as soap and up-cycled clothing), and artists showcasing their work. The market is a brilliant addition to a new wave of vegan places in London and, hopefully, it&#8217;ll be the first of many.</p>
<p><em>Market stalls curated by Fat Gay Vegan are selected under an <a href="http://fatgayvegan.com/2017/02/25/monthly-vegan-market-in-london/">inclusive policy</a>.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone deserves great cake – that’s the joyous vision of Ms Cupcake, a vegan bakery in Brixton Village. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ms Cupcake was founded in 2011 by Mellissa Morgan. She had moved to London from Canada, many years previously, and noticed a gap in the market for vegan sweet treats. In 2010, Mellissa decided to fill it herself. She began baking indulgent vegan cakes at home and selling them at London markets. Just one year later, due the high demand for her specialist treats, Mellissa set up shop in Brixton Village.</p>
<p>Inside Ms Cupcake, you’ll find freshly baked cupcakes, layer cakes, cookies, muffins, squares, sandwiches, savoury treats, milkshakes and ice-cream sodas. Everything is 100% vegan and a fair share of the baked goods are free from wheat and gluten. Most customers probably don’t even realise this, which is a testament to the texture and flavour of the cakes.</p>
<p>The bakery has an open-plan layout, which means everything is baked and decorated on the premises in front of customers. The friendly staff are more than happy to talk you through their wide range of mouth-watering cupcakes (including lemon, banoffee, strawberry champagne, black forest, raspberry cheesecake, rose and red velvet); brownies (including Oreo and walnut); and many other decadent treats.</p>
<p>Most of the cupcakes are priced at £2.60, and the other sweet treats at around £3. Thankfully, being naughty won’t break the bank.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[For vegan sweet treats that look as good as they taste, Rubys of London is hard to beat.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2000, vegan baker Ruby opened a stall in Greenwich Market to sell her handmade vegan treats. Business boomed and, today, Rubys of London is an award-winning vegan patisserie. They can now deliver treats directly to your door if you live in Greater London, but the stall is still going strong every Saturday and Sunday in Greenwich Market.</p>
<p>On her website, Ruby describes how she began baking at an early age. A childhood dairy and egg allergy meant she was often unable to taste the birthday cakes of her friends, and that’s where her passion and flair for creating edible works of art began.</p>
<p>‘Edible works of art’ is no exaggeration. The carefully decorated cupcakes are exquisite and always draw a crowd. There’s a wide range of fruity, nutty and chocolate flavour combinations to choose from. The sponge is light and the cupcakes burst with flavour – they simply taste as delicious as they look.</p>
<p>Alongside cupcakes, you can buy mini loaves, cake slices, desserts, biscuits, brownies and doughnuts. Many of the vegan goods are free from wheat, gluten and refined sugars. Considering the quality of the bakes and the free-from ingredients used, the goods are reasonably priced.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a joy to behold, let alone taste, such creative bakes. This popular market stall is definitely worth a visit.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Vegan Sweet Tooth pops up at markets and festivals across London, selling delicious sweet treats and baked goods.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This charming Italian patisserie stall is run by professional chef Giancarlo Roncato, who turned his hand to vegan baking in 2012. He specialises in organic, &#8216;free-from&#8217; sweet and savoury treats, inspired by his Italian heritage. Across the range of cakes, pastries, breads and quiches, you’ll find different sugar-free, nut-free, gluten-free or soya-free options.</p>
<p>The sweet treats are popular, so it’s a good thing that the stall is well stocked. You’ll find cakes such as blueberry and lavender, lemon and rosemary, carrot and date, and zebra marble; and tarts like chocolate and pear, berry jam, chocolate frangipane and almond frangipane. There are a few more unusual flavour combinations to choose from, like black pepper and strawberry, if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous. And there’s usually a selection of biscuits and muffins on offer, too.</p>
<p>The savoury offerings include delicious pastries, Italian breads such as focaccia, pizza and quiche (for example, spinach, leek, pea and kale), which can be served with a side salad.</p>
<p>Giancarlo is full of passion for vegan baking, and this shines through when you talk to him at the stall. His friendliness and great flavours will no doubt keep you, like many others, going back for more.</p>
<p>To find out where the stall will be popping up next, see Vegan Sweet Tooth&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vegansweettoothlondon/events/?ref=page_internal">Facebook page</a>.</p>
