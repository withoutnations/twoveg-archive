				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EZ &#038; Moss has been brightening up Holloway Road since it opened its doors in 2013. The charming cafe, with its simple but delicious veggie and vegan food, is a hit with both locals and those who work nearby. </p>
<p>Inside, the long, narrow cafe is light and tranquil; tables for two made out of reclaimed wood line one wall, and a small kitchen and counter line the wall opposite. There’s a larger table at the front of the cafe, under the window, and a few seats outside if you fancy watching the world go by.</p>
<p>Fresh flowers in vases, dried flowers in old food tins, soft lighting, scaffold shelving, vintage signs and quirky pictures give the cafe a style that’s part bohemian, part industrial. The music is low, making conversation – or working without distraction – easy.</p>
<p>The menu is concise but caters perfectly well for those looking for breakfast, brunch or lunch. There’s porridge, chia pudding, homemade granola, scrambled eggs on toast, veggie and vegan omelettes, and a larger breakfast consisting of two soft-boiled eggs, British cheese, avocado, cucumber, tomatoes and toast. Avocado on toast is served with chilli-coriander relish, watercress and <em>dukkah</em> (a mixture of nuts and spices), which turns a simple dish into an outstanding one. </p>
<p>For lunch, there’s a range of grilled sandwiches, an impressive vegan lentil and quinoa burger, and a &#8216;veganwarma&#8217; served on flatbread with coleslaw, potato salad, tahini sauce and pickles. Daily specials include a fresh salad, a quiche and a soup. All of the food is served on vintage crockery, adding to the cafe’s charm. </p>
<p>You can find a good selection of veggie and vegan cakes at the counter, and Allpress coffee, which you can take out if you’re just passing by. But it’s worth staying a while, if you can – this place has something special.</p>
