		<description><![CDATA[Cookies, cakes, brownies and shakes await you at this Holloway bakery – all vegan, gluten-free and delicious.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cookies and Scream began selling vegan bakes from a market stall in Camden Lock back in 2010. Two years later, as demand grew, the stall turned into a <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/cookies-and-scream-camden/">permanent cookie bar</a> inside the market – this remained hugely popular until a fire in 2017 sadly forced it to close. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Cookies and Scream had opened a bakery on Holloway Road in 2016, not too far from Highbury and Islington station. It&#8217;s a small, friendly place with a few tables and chairs, and retro bar stools you can pull up to the counter.</p>
<p>The glass display case that greets you when you walk through the door shows off tempting fresh bakes – all of which are vegan and gluten-free. What’s on offer changes daily and varies by demand, but the selection is impressive.</p>
<p>The cookies are big and filling, crispy on the edge and moist in the middle; varieties like chocolate chip, oatmeal and chocolate chip, double chocolate, and ginger. There are brownies, blondies (brownies without the cocoa), pies and oven-baked donuts, with winning flavour combinations such as peanut butter and chocolate, coconut and jam, and salted caramel and chocolate. The bakes taste even better when they&#8217;re warmed in the oven. Then there&#8217;s the signature cookie ‘sandwich’, which packs a creamy ice cream between two delicious cookies – definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>The bakery also serves coffee, tea and its popular &#8216;Scream Shakes&#8217;: a combination of ice cream, milk and blended brownie or cookie, served with a specially developed sauce or fresh fruit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something to satisfy everyone’s sweet tooth at Cookies and Scream – it&#8217;s well worth a trip when you fancy a treat.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This friendly vegetarian cafe on Holloway Road is a real find. With great food and coffee, it's the perfect place for a quiet catch up. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EZ &#038; Moss has been brightening up Holloway Road since it opened its doors in 2013. The charming cafe, with its simple but delicious veggie and vegan food, is a hit with both locals and those who work nearby. </p>
<p>Inside, the long, narrow cafe is light and tranquil; tables for two made out of reclaimed wood line one wall, and a small kitchen and counter line the wall opposite. There’s a larger table at the front of the cafe, under the window, and a few seats outside if you fancy watching the world go by.</p>
<p>Fresh flowers in vases, dried flowers in old food tins, soft lighting, scaffold shelving, vintage signs and quirky pictures give the cafe a style that’s part bohemian, part industrial. The music is low, making conversation – or working without distraction – easy.</p>
<p>The menu is concise but caters perfectly well for those looking for breakfast, brunch or lunch. There’s porridge, chia pudding, homemade granola, scrambled eggs on toast, veggie and vegan omelettes, and a larger breakfast consisting of two soft-boiled eggs, British cheese, avocado, cucumber, tomatoes and toast. Avocado on toast is served with chilli-coriander relish, watercress and <em>dukkah</em> (a mixture of nuts and spices), which turns a simple dish into an outstanding one. </p>
<p>For lunch, there’s a range of grilled sandwiches, an impressive vegan lentil and quinoa burger, and a &#8216;veganwarma&#8217; served on flatbread with coleslaw, potato salad, tahini sauce and pickles. Daily specials include a fresh salad, a quiche and a soup. All of the food is served on vintage crockery, adding to the cafe’s charm. </p>
<p>You can find a good selection of veggie and vegan cakes at the counter, and Allpress coffee, which you can take out if you’re just passing by. But it’s worth staying a while, if you can – this place has something special.</p>
