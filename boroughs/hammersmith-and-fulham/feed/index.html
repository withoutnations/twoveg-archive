		<description><![CDATA[Looking for homely, hearty vegan food in West Kensington? 222 Vegan Cuisine has plenty.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This popular vegan restaurant (previously 222 Veggie Vegan) opened its doors in 2004 and is run by chef Ben Asamani, who serves up delicious dishes to satisfy your appetite. Everything on the menu is prepared using fresh, natural ingredients and cooking techniques that preserve nutritional value – there&#8217;s no deep-frying or microwaving here.</p>
<p>The all-you-can-eat lunchtime buffet, available from midday to 3.30pm, is good value for money: £7.50 to eat-in or £5.50 for a takeaway box. There’s a selection of tasty raw salads and hot dishes to choose from.</p>
<p>The evening à la carte service starts at 6pm, when the small restaurant fills up quickly. With its minimal decor and candlelit tables, 222 Vegan Cuisine has a cosy, unpretentious atmosphere. The menu is equally down to earth. Starters include homemade soup, a bean and tofu pancake, and pitta bread with dips. The hearty mains include a roast, pasta basilico, pumpkin and pine nut risotto, a tofu veggie burger and the customers’ favourite, seitan stroganoff. Simple dishes, but full of flavour. There are also salads and a couple of raw dishes, if you fancy something lighter. Desserts include tofu cheesecake, ice cream and raw chocolate torte. To quench your thirst: hot drinks, fresh juices and smoothies, and wine and beer with affordable organic options.</p>
<p>The wholesome, satisfying food at 222 Vegan Cuisine is no doubt what makes the restaurant so popular among vegans and non-vegans alike. It’s a big hit with families too. Make sure you book ahead for dinner – the word is definitely out.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Gate in Hammersmith is one of London's longest-serving vegetarian restaurants and a favourite of many.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opened in 1989 by brothers Adrian and Michael Daniel, The Gate has served a menu celebrating Indian, Arabic and Jewish influences for more than 27 years. The Daniels’ success led them to open a <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/gate-islington/">second location</a> in Islington in 2012, and a third in Marylebone in 2016.</p>
<p>The original restaurant is nestled in a small courtyard in Hammersmith. Inside, there&#8217;s an immediate intimacy and warmth, thanks to the low lighting, candles on tables and an eye-catching wall that&#8217;s covered in colourful, reclaimed planks of wood. While tables are set closely together, the room is quiet and it&#8217;s easy to relax and get lost in conversation. Staff are friendly and helpful. During the summer, tables are set up in the courtyard for those lucky enough to dine in the sun.</p>
<p>The seasonal à la carte menu is the same at all three restaurants; there&#8217;s no shortage of options to choose from, and special menus offer unique dishes dedicated to a theme, such as The Gate&#8217;s annual wild mushroom festival. From mizo glazed aubergine to Mediterranean tart, the starters neatly canvas The Gate&#8217;s mixed culinary influences. Mains are no different: rotolo, Malaysian curry, an aubergine schnitzel and what may be the most striking dish, a tower of sweet potato and blackbean tortillas. Salads and sides are also available. A wine rack near the kitchen is well stocked with a selection of organic, vegan options. Stay for a decadent dessert – a soft cappuccino cheesecake, perhaps, or a strawberry eaton mess.</p>
<p>The Gate prides itself on inventive food, combining ingredients in unexpected ways. With a separate menu for children, Sunday roasts and lunch options, there&#8217;s something for everyone. Book ahead – there&#8217;s rarely an empty table in sight.</p>
