		<description><![CDATA[Manna is deservedly one of London's most renowned vegan restaurants – one not to be missed.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London is home to many long-standing vegetarian and vegan restaurants, some of which have been in business for more than 20 or 30 years. But Manna beats all others – it&#8217;s the oldest in the UK. This elegant Primrose Hill restaurant celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2017.</p>
<p>A change in post-war living and the counter-movements of the 1960s led many people to adopt vegetarianism. Manna is credited as leading the way from early on by promoting healthy and sustainable eating through a vegetarian diet. Today, the restaurant follows an animal product-free philosophy, providing a menu that is entirely vegan.</p>
<p>The food at Manna is international and varied with lots of interesting starters and sides. Menu items are often seasonal and there are daily specials, but on the starters list you might come across a cannelloni bean slider, cashew cheese croquettes or vegetable tempura. There&#8217;s also a mixed mezze (a choice of three starters), salads and sharing plates. </p>
<p>For mains, you might find fennel and pumpkin seed bangers and mash, Thai curry, an enchilada bake and a pasta dish, to name a few. The pasta is served with Manna&#8217;s signature &#8216;veatballs&#8217;. Chef&#8217;s specials are available, as well as a &#8216;build your own meal&#8217; – a selection of four sides served as a main. To follow, there&#8217;s a selection of decadent desserts made with cashew cheese and &#8216;vice&#8217; cream. There&#8217;s a good selection of organic and vegan wines and beer in-house, as well soft drinks and spirits. </p>
<p>The restaurant is cosy but not crowded, with a comfortable number of tables and a small conservatory at the front. The dark wooden furniture is contrasted by the white walls and accentuated by candles and decorative ceiling lights. As the acoustics are good, it&#8217;s easy to keep conversation.</p>
<p>After half a century in business, Manna still has a unique offering and is as popular as ever – something that many of London&#8217;s new veggie and vegan places will aspire to.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mildreds Camden opened in 2015, in the image of well-known vegetarian restaurant Mildreds. It's now popular in its own right.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inside Mildreds Camden, some of the vibrant cafe style that has long-defined <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/mildreds-soho/">Mildreds Soho</a> is carried on. Retro green benches, wooden cafe tables and hanging bronze pendant lights contrast the aptly named Glass Building in which the restaurant sits. The colourful circus wallpaper on the walls and abstract photographs add a bit of quirkiness. And while the windows look out onto the bustling Jamestown Road, the restaurant provides a nice respite from the crowds of Camden Market nearby.</p>
<p>The menu is similar to Mildreds Soho&#8217;s, and most of the options are vegan. Some of the dishes have been tried and tested over the years, like the mushroom and ale pie with mushy peas and the smoked tofu burger. But there are plenty of new dishes to try as well, like the Vietnamese mock duck and rice noodle bowl, or the deep-fried buttermilk and polenta mock chicken. The tempting starters or small plates include hoummus with rose harissa and chargrilled flatbread, gyoza dumplings, and roasted miso aubergine. There&#8217;s a good selection of mouth-watering puddings, cakes and truffles that are mostly vegan. Cocktails, mocktails, organic wine, beer, cider, coffee and soft drinks are all available.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a large bar area at the entrance, which, like in Mildreds Soho, is the best place to wait for a table when it&#8217;s busy. The bar also doubles as a serving table at lunchtime when salads, soup, quiche and daily specials are served. Bookings are only accepted for large groups, but the waiting times are reasonable. Staff are friendly and accommodating.</p>
<p>With a name and reputation firmly established, Mildreds Camden has had a lot to live up to; judging by the great food and full tables, things are going well. Good news, as a third restaurant followed in <a href="https://www.twoveg.uk/mildreds-kings-cross/">King&#8217;s Cross</a>.</p>
